1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
Latex was very interesting to learn and I never used overleaf!

Perhaps being able to predict potential disease within microbiomes. 
3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
Maybe having more NLP projects as I did not feel there were many and not much of a variety.
4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
I just really want to put my ML skills to use!
